# Abalone Age Prediction

This project aims to predict the age of abalones based on their physical measurements using a linear regression model. The dataset used contains various physical measurements of abalones, and the goal is to predict the number of rings, which can be used to estimate their age.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains 4,177 instances of abalones and 8 features. The features include:
- Sex: Categorical (M, F, I)
- Length: Continuous (mm)
- Diameter: Continuous (mm)
- Height: Continuous (mm)
- Whole_weight: Continuous (grams)
- Shucked_weight: Continuous (grams)
- Viscera_weight: Continuous (grams)
- Shell_weight: Continuous (grams)
- Rings: Integer (target variable)

The age of an abalone can be estimated as `Rings + 1.5`.
## Step 1: Understanding the Data
1. First, let's summarize the dataset and its features:
2. Categorical Feature: Sex (M, F, I)
3. Continuous Features: Length, Diameter, Height, Whole_weight, Shucked_weight, Viscera_weight, Shell_weight
4. Target Variable: Rings (which, when adjusted, gives the age)

## Step 2: Preparing the Environment

Python installed.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

```

# Step 3: Load the dataset
Place the CSV file (abalone.csv) in the same directory as my Python script
Import pandas:
pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
```
Read the CSV file:

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame

df = pd.read_csv('abalone.csv')

Inspect the Data

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())
```
 Verify the Column Names
Ensure that the column names match the ones described in the dataset information. Sometimes, the first row might be treated as header incorrectly if the file format is not as expected.
Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame:
```
import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('abalone.csv')
# Display the first few rows to ensure it loaded correctly
print(df.head())
# Optionally, inspect the column names and data types
print(df.columns)
print(df.dtypes)
```

# Step 3: Load the dataset
